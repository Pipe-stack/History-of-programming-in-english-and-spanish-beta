    <p class="text">Programming began in the 1940s with the first electronic <br> computers. Ada Lovelace, in 1843, is considered the first programmer <br> for creating an algorithm for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, <br> although the first programmable computers came much later.

        In the 1950s, the first programming languages like Fortran and Lisp <br> emerged, making it easier to interact with machines. Then, in the <br> 60s and 70s, languages like C and Pascal were developed, <br> and the first commercial applications started to emerge.
        
        During the 80s, languages like C++ and Java gained popularity. In the <br> 90s, the web transformed programming, and languages like JavaScript, HTML, <br> and CSS began to dominate web development.
        
        In the 21st century, technologies like Python, Ruby, and Node.js <br> became common, while approaches like Agile development and cloud programming <br> changed the way software is created.
        
        Today, programming is fundamental in nearly all industries, with languages, <br> frameworks, and tools that constantly evolve.
